		This exercise compares different hashing functions.

		(a)	Write a program that creates a hash table of strings whose values come from the ordered list of words in "sdict.dat."
		Use the hash function object type hFstring from "d_hashf.h," and set the hash table size to 1423.
		Start a timer object, and input strings from the file "udict.dat," which is a random ordering of "sdict.dat."
		Look up each string in the ahs table.
		Upon reaching the end of file, output the time required for the search activity.
